# Contributing

Welcome to the k8s-athenz-syncer-the-hard-clean-way project! We appreciate your interest in contributing to this open-source project. To ensure a smooth collaboration, let us share some philosophy behind the project and guidelines for contributing.

## Philosophy

This project tries to demonstrate the sync between Athenz Role and Kubernetes RBAC only using `ZMS API calls`. This project is also designed not to care about the performance or scalability. The main goal is to help users understand how the sync works under the hood.

## Code Structure

### main.go

The entry point for the controller manager, that does, in order:

1. Reads configuration from local file
1. Sets up any clients (Athenz client, Kubernetes client, etc) that will be shared across controllers
1. Registers controllers with the manager
1. Starts the manager to begin reconciliation loops


### internal/config

Loads configuration file defined by `main.go`

### internal/controller & internal/poller

List of controllers that this operator `k8s-athenz-syncer-the-hard-clean-way` can do.

Controllers's code should be neat so that it is easier to grab the flow of reconciliation logic.

Core jobs:

- `NamespaceController`: Use namespaces as SSOT, and syncs:
  - Athenz Sub Domains, if not exist
  - Athenz Default Roles, if not exist
  - Kubernetes necessary RBAC Roles, if not exist
- `AthenzDomainPoller`: Every minute, check all athenz roles under certain Parent domain, and syncs:
  - Kubernetes RBAC Roles, if not synced


### internal/syncer

> [!NOTE]
> Please name your code with the SSOT file data type, so if operator syncs with Namespace, name it `namespace.go`, if it syncs with Athenz Role, name it `athenzrole.go`, etc.

List of core syncer logics that controllers use to perform the sync between Athenz and Kubernetes.


### pkg/athenz

> [!TIP]
>`pkg` does not include any business logics, or config imports.

Self-created athenz library to interact with Athenz ZMS server using ZMS APIs. I could have used the official Athenz Go client library, but I wanted to keep this project simple and focused on demonstrating the sync logic.
